## URL Shortener 
You give this web app a big scary link and get a short link that people might not be so intimidated to click (if you own a short domain name that is). Just like [tinyURL](https://tinyurl.com/app) or [bitly](https://bitly.com/)

Features:
* Manage multiple shortened links in a dashboard
* Account creation and login
* See statistics and data on individual link traffic
* get links as QR code image

Built with Java, Javalin framework
* H2 database 
* Hibernate ORM
* Sessions: Json Web Tokens 
* Jasypt for password encryption
* MVC design pattern
* Server side Templating with Thymeleaf
* SOAP gRPC

UI is functional but extremely jank
